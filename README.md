# Laser-Optical-Transceiver
This project is an embedded optical communication system that transmits digital text messages across physical space using a laser beam. The system encodes standard ASCII characters into binary light pulses, transmits them via a laser diode, and decodes the incoming light fluctuations back into human-readable text on an I2C LCD screen.
